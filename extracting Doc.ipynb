      "What is economics?\n",
      "Economics is the study of resources ( Land, Labour, Capital ). Resources are also factors of production. *Resources are scarce but needs or wants are unlimited. \n",
      "Economics is the study of how things are made, moved around, and used. It looks at how people, businesses, governments, and countries choose to use their resources. Economics is the study of how people act, based on the idea that people act rationally and try to get the most value or benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is produce in economics? \n",
      "There are different needs of every human in the society, considering that it is decided which goods and services are to be produced and in what quantity are they required in the society. As the resources are scarce, the production of one means sacrificing another. Production has to be done in a way that maximum satisfaction is achieved by society by looking into what is more important than another.\n",
      "This problem involves selection of goods and services to be produced and the quantity to be produced of each selected commodity. Every economy has limited resources and thus, cannot produce all the goods. More of one good or service usually means less of others.\n",
      "For example, production of more sugar is possible only by reducing the production of other goods.\n",
      "How to produce?\n",
      "This problem refers to selection of technique to be used for production of goods and services. A good can be produced using different techniques of production. By ‘technique’, we mean which particular combination of inputs to be used. Generally, techniques are classified as: Labour intensive techniques (LIT) and Capital intensive techniques (CIT).\n",
      "How to distribute?\n",
      "Distribution in economics refers to the way total output, income, or wealth is distributed among individuals or among the factors of production (such as labour, land, and capital).  In general theory and the national income and product accounts, each unit of output corresponds to a unit of income.\n",
      "Scarcity: The limited nature of society’s resources (land, labour, capital). Various trade-offs are to be made to allocate the resources in the most efficient way possible.\n",
      "Choice: \n",
      "\n",
      "Opportunity cost: It is the value of the next best alternative forgone for a particular choice.\n",
      "Efficiency: The property of society getting the most it can out of its scarce resources\n"
